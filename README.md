# Code Pal for ABAP - Cloud Edition

## About this Project

Code Pal is a project that provides ATC checks to assist ABAP programmers in adhering to the [Clean ABAP style guide](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md). This is a version of that project that provides ATC checks that can be executed in an ABAP Cloud (["Steampunk"](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/08/20/its-steampunk-now/)) environment and modern on-premise installations (`SAP_BASIS` release equal to or greater than 7.56). The legacy version for SAP_BASIS releases starting at 7.40 is [here](https://github.com/SAP/code-pal-for-abap).


## Requirements and Setup

Install via [abapGit Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/abapGit/ADT_Frontend) on ABAP cloud systems and [abapGit for SAPGUI](https://docs.abapgit.org/guide-online-install.html) on systems with SAP_BASIS 7.57 or higher.

Long-term compatibility is only guaranteed for the current version of ABAP for Cloud Development. 

## Features

Our main functional goals that differ from the legacy version are:

 - Providing automated quick fixes for many findings in ADT
 - Enabling all checks to run in a [remote check scenario](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/12/12/remote-code-analysis-in-atc-one-central-check-system-for-multiple-systems-on-various-releases/).
 - All code lives in the `/CC4A/` (Clean Code for ABAP) namespace so collisions with Y*/Z* objects from other projects are avoided

The [check migration list](check_migration_list.md) shows the current migration status of checks from the legacy version.
